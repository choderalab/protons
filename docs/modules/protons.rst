Setting up a constant-pH MD simulation
**************************************

.. automodule:: protons

The :py:mod:`protons` package extends OpenMM with the capability to alter the configuration of protons in simulation.
This allows for sampling over multiple protonation states and prototropic tautomers of amino acid residues and small molcules.
These effects have been shown as important in multiple biological systems [1]_, and now you can include them in OpenMM simulations.


Setting up the :py:class:`ProtonDrive` class
============================================

In order to run a simulation containing multiple protonation states and tautomers, you can use :py:class:`ProtonDrive`.
This object is responsible for keeping track of the current system state, and updates the OpenMM context with the correct parameters.
It uses an instantaneous Monte Carlo sampling method [2]_ to update implicit solvent systems.
Explicit solvent systems can be updated using NCMC [3]_, [4]_.
The driver maintains a dictionary of all possible protonation states and tautomers of each residue in the simulation system, and their parameters in the AMBER99 constant-pH force field [2]_.

To instantiate the :py:class:`ProtonDrive`, you need a prmtop file (loaded using :py:class:`simtk.openmm.app.AmberPrmtopFile`),
and an OpenMM system (:py:class:`simtk.openmm.openmm.System`).
Additionally, a ``.cpin`` file (generated by ``cpinutil.py``, which is part of Ambertools) is needed to provide information on amino acid parameters.
In order to perform NCMC, you need to provide the integrator that you will use for the regular MD part as well.
The implementation of NCMC uses a Velocity Verlet integrator, so make sure that your integrator is not timewise incompatible like for instance Leapfrog integrators.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:
    :emphasize-lines: 11,20

    from protons import ProtonDrive
    from simtk import unit, openmm
    from simtk.openmm import app
    from openmmtools.integrators import VelocityVerletIntegrator

    # Load a protein system
    prmtop = app.AmberPrmtopFile('protein.prmtop')
    cpin_filename = 'protein.cpin'

    # System settings
    pH = 7.4
    temperature = 300.0 * unit.kelvin

    # Define an integrator for the system
    integrator = VelocityVerletIntegrator(1.0 * unit.femtoseconds)

    # Create an implicit solvent system from the AMBER prmtop file
    system = prmtop.createSystem(implicitSolvent=app.OBC2, nonbondedMethod=app.NoCutoff, constraints=app.HBonds)
    # Create the driver that will update the protons on the system and track its state
    driver = ProtonDrive(system, temperature, pH, prmtop, cpin_filename, integrator, pressure=None, ncmc_steps_per_trial=0, implicit=True)

    # Create a simulation object using the correct integrator
    simulation = app.Simulation(prmtop.topology, system, driver.compound_integrator, platform)

Next, you will need to provide reference free energies for each residue in solvent.


Solvent reference state calibrations
====================================

In order to simulate a protein or small molecule with multiple protonation states and/or tautomers, it is necessary to calculate the free energy difference between a reference state.
This free energy can depend on the temperature, solvent model, pressure, pH and other factors. It is therefore imperative that this is run whenever you've changed simulation settings.

Individual states are denoted with a subscript :math:`k`.
We use self-adjusted mixture sampling (SAMS) to calculate :math:`g_k`, a reference free energy.
The :math:`g_k` s correct for (electrostatic) force field contribution to the free energy difference between the reference states, so that the populations produced in simulation match what is expected from the pH dependence, or tautomeric populations.


Residues
--------

The package supports automatic :math:`g_k` calculations the following residues by default, denoted by the residue name with the max number of protons added.
The reference state is taken to be the state of a single capped amino acids in water.

* Glutamic acid, ``GL4`` (pKa=4.4)
* Aspartic acid, ``AS4`` (pKa=4.0)
* Histidine, ``HIP``  (pKa delta=6.5, pKa epsilon = 7.1)
* Tyrosine, ``TYR`` (pKa=9.6)
* Cysteine, ``CYS`` (pKa=8.5)
* Lysine, ``LYS`` (pKa=10.4)

To automatically calibrate all amino acids available in a system, one can use the :py:meth:`ProtonDrive.calibrate` method.

The :py:meth:`ProtonDrive.calibrate` method
-------------------------------------------

The :py:meth:`ProtonDrive.calibrate` method will set this up automatically for the settings you have provided.

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:

    calibration_results = driver.calibrate()

It will automatically perform a free energy calculation using self-adjusted mixture sampling (SAMS) to calculate the reference free energy for each state :math:`g_k`.
While this is conveniently carried out automatically, this may take quite some time (minutes to 2-hours on a GTX-Titan per unique residue type).
We are experimenting with a setup that can perform calibration in parallel so that you can run calibration more efficiently.
If you store these results, you can reload them in a subsequent run.


.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    # Pre-calculated values
    # temperature = 300.0 * unit.kelvin
    # pressure = None
    # timestep = 1.0 * unit.femtoseconds
    # pH = 7.4
    # Amber 99 constant ph residues

    calibration_results = {'as4': np.array([3.98027947e-04,  -3.61785292e+01,  -3.98046143e+01,
                                            -3.61467735e+01,  -3.97845096e+01]),
                           'cys': np.array([7.64357397e-02,   1.30386793e+02]),
                           'gl4': np.array([9.99500333e-04,  -5.88268681e+00,  -8.98650420e+00,
                                            -5.87149375e+00,  -8.94086390e+00]),
                           'hip': np.array([2.39229276,   5.38886021,  13.12895206]),
                           'lys': np.array([9.99500333e-04,  -1.70930870e+01]),
                           'tyr': np.array([6.28975142e-03,   1.12467299e+02])}

    driver.import_gk_values(calibration_results)


.. warning::
    When reusing calibrated values, you must make sure that you are using the exact same force field, pH and other properties of the system.
    If you are not sure, we recommend that you rerun the calibration.


For more in depth explanation of the calibration procedure, please see :ref:`advanced_calibration`.

Now that :math:`g_k` values have been calibrated, you are ready to run a simulation.

Running the simulation
======================

After calibration, you can start running a simulation. The residue states are updated using the :py:meth:`ProtonDrive.update` method.
This method modifies the parameters in your simulation context.

Decide on the number of timesteps, and the frequency of updating the residue states. To propagate in regular dynamics, just use ``simulation.step``.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    nupdates, mc_frequency = 10000, 6000

    for iteration in range(1, nupdates):
        simulation.step(mc_frequency) # MD
        driver.update(simulation.context)  # protonation

This means that every 6000 steps of molecular dynamics, the residue states are driven once for a total of 10000 iteration.

Tracking the simulation
=======================

This section and the API still need to be written.
