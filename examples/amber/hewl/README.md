Constant-pH test from amber11 (hen egg white lysozyme)

cpin file was generated via:
```
cpinutil.py -p prmtop > cpin
```
which uses new Python version of cpinutil

Note that the Python `cpinutil` tools written by Jason Swails are preferred because they use a standard non-Fortran namelist format:
```
amber12/AmberTools/src/etc/cpinutil/
```
